/*
C# .NET Console APP
Take user input
Input validation
Use a collection to store data
Have a menu with atleast 3 options
Transform or do some calculation with that data
////////////////////

- validate input: maybe the user inputs their age or something, and maybe you gotta make sure it is a number and not some letters.
- use a collection: maybe it's a list of something
- have a menu with 3 options: this is just a switch statement, such as add a movie, add new users, add a new car, etc.  one option can even be to quit the app. (we never learned menu so maybe i can do this part next time?)
- manipulate data: maybe u have a list of movies, and u can get the average rating of the movie.  maybe a user can input a movie name and a rating, and one of the "options"?  (maybe the menu?) you can get the calculated average rating.
